# Customer-Personality-Analysis
## Overview
This project explores customer segmentation using machine learning techniques to identify groups based on:

Spending patterns
Campaign responsiveness
Demographic factors
Two major approaches were used:

PCA with K-Means Clustering: For variance-based segmentation and efficiency.
NMF with GMM: For interpretable latent factors and probabilistic clustering.
